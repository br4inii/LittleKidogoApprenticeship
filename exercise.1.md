    Which of the following will match?
    a = [1, 2, 3]
    a = 4
    4 = a
    [a, b] = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
    a = [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] ]
    [a] = [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] ]
    [[a]] = [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] ]

    The following match
     a=[1,2,3]
     a=4
     4=a
     a=[[1,2,3]]
     [a]=[[1,2,3]]

     The following wount match
     [a,b]=[1,2,3] the elements of both sides of the '='                    sign should be of equal magnitude.

     [[a]]=[[1,2,3]]
